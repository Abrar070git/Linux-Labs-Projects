Question:

The Aquila DevOps team has developed automation scripts to streamline routine operational tasks. Before deploying these scripts across all backend servers in the Orion data center, they want to perform a test run using a sample cron job. Please complete the following steps:

a. Install the cronie package and ensure the crond service is started on all Orion backend servers.

b. Configure a cron job for the root user to execute the command echo hello > /tmp/cron_text every 5 minutes.

Solution:

sudo dnf install -y cronie   ---> to install it

sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemc enable crond 

sudo crontab -e   ---> Open the root user's crontab:

*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text  ---> Add the following line to the crontab file save and exit:

sudo crontab -l  ----> Check the crontab to confirm the job is added:

To Verify It's Working

Wait 5â€“10 minutes and check the content of the file:

cat /tmp/cron_text
