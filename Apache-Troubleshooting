QUESTION:

xFusionCorp Industries uses some monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc running on the systems. Recently, the monitoring system identified that Apache service is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.


1. Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Server and fix the issue. Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers. Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.


2. Apache is running on 8083 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.


3. Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should be reachable and you should get some static page. E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:8083/.

SOLUTION:

ssh tony@stapp01 
sudo -i

systemctl enable httpd
systemctl status httpd
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  ----------> check line no 43

# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
# Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the
# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at
# least PidFile.
#
ServerRoot "/etc/httpd;"  <---------------- fix it remove the ";" from the end and start again
ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"   <---------------- change it to this

systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

ssh steve@stapp02
