QUESTION:

Some users of the monitoring app have reported issues with xFusionCorp Industries mail server. They have a mail server in Stork DC where they are using postfix mail transfer agent. Postfix service seems to fail. Try to identify the root cause and fix it.

SOLUTION:

ssh groot@stmail01 ----> redirect to the password
sudo su -          ----> enter the password

vim /etc/postfix/main.cf

# Note: you need to stop/start Postfix when this parameter changes.
#
inet_interfaces = all
#inet_interfaces = $myhostname
#inet_interfaces = $myhostname, localhost
#inet_interfaces = localhost    <--------  comment this line

systemctl restart postfix
systemctl status postfix
