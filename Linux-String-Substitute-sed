Question:

There is some data on Nautilus App Server 1 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. On Nautilus App Server 1, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:

a. Delete all lines containing word copyright and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)

b. Replace all occurrence of word from to them and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.

Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing the string itself; for example upto, contributor etc.

Solution:

grep -v "copyright" /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_DELETE.txt

Explanation:

grep -v 'copyright': Finds all lines not containing the exact word copyright (case-sensitive).

>: Redirects the output to /home/BSD_DELETE.txt.

Replace exact word from with them, excluding words like fromTo, transform, etc:

sed 's/\bfrom\b/them/g' /home/BSD_DELETE.txt > /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt
