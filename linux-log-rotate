QUESTION:

The Nautilus DevOps team is ready to launch a new application, which they will deploy on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. They are expecting significant traffic/usage of squid on app servers after that. This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. To utilise the storage efficiently, they need to compress the log files and need to rotate old logs. Check the requirements shared below:


a. In all app servers install squid package.

b. Using logrotate configure squid logs rotation to monthly and keep only 3 rotated logs.

(If by default log rotation is set, then please update configuration as needed)


SOLUTION:

ssh tony@stapp01  ----> redirect to the password and become sudo 
sudo -i 

yum install squid -y

vi /etc/logrotate.d/squid 
[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /etc/logrotate.d/squid 
/var/log/squid/*.log {
    monthly
    rotate 3
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    missingok
    nocreate
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
      # Asks squid to reopen its logs. (logfile_rotate 0 is set in squid.conf)
      # errors redirected to make it silent if squid is not running
      /usr/sbin/squid -k rotate 2>/dev/null
    endscript
}

systemctl restart squid
systemctl status squid
