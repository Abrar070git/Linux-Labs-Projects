QUESTION:

To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we have decided to go with the given requirements listed below:


a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port, i.e 80.

b. Block all incoming connections on Apache port, i.e 8080.

c. All rules must be permanent.

d. Zone should be public.

e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already, please make sure to start them.

SOLUTION:

firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
success

firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=8080/tcp --permanent
Warning: NOT_ENABLED: 8080:tcp
success

firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
success

firewall-cmd --reload
success
