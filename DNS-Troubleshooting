QUESTION:

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.

As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

SOLUTION:

ssh steve@stapp02   ----> enter the password

sudo su -           ----> enter the password

cat /etc/resolv.conf

search stratos.xfusioncorp.com
nameserver 127.0.0.11
options ndots:0

sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf   ---> add the bottom two lines

search stratos.xfusioncorp.com
nameserver 127.0.0.11
options ndots:0 
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
