QUESTION:

We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 6000 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

2. Block incoming port 6200 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

SOLUTION:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i

dnf update -y && dnf install iptables-services -y

# Allow traffic to port 6200 only from LBR
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6200 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT

# Drop all other incoming traffic to port 6200
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6200 -j DROP

service iptables save

systemctl start iptables
systemctl status iptables

# now ssh into the loki lbr

ssh loki@stlb01

curl http://stapp03:6200

need to do it in all the hosts
