QUESTION:

Some of the developers from Nautilus project team have asked for SFTP access to at least one of the app server in Stratos DC. After going through the requirements, the system admins team has decided to configure the SFTP server on App Server 1 server in Stratos Datacenter. Please configure it as per the following instructions:


a. Create a SFTP user rose and set its password to 8FmzjvFU6S. There is already a group called ftp, you can utilise the same.

b. Password authentication should be enabled for this user.

c. SFTP user should only be allowed to make SFTP connections.

SOLUTION:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i

useradd -m -g ftp rose   ------> -m creates a home directory for the user, -g ftp ensures the user is added to the ftp group.

getent rose
Unknown database: rose

passwd rose -----> 8FmzjvFU6S  
mkdir -p /var/sftp/rose
chmod 755 /var/sftp/rose



vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# override default of no subsystems
#Subsystem      sftp    /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server

Subsystem      sftp  internal-sftp
Match User rose
PasswordAuthentication yes
ForceCommand internal-sftp
ChrootDirectory /var/sftp/
PermitTunnel no
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no

systemctl restart sshd
