QUESTION:

Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 8087 (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.

Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:8087 command from jump host.


SOLUTION:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i		<----- redirect to the password

systemctl status httpd.service
systemctl start httpd.service

journalctl -xeu httpd.service

netstat -tunlp | grep -i 8087   <-------------- stop sendmain service which is running on port 8087

systemctl start httpd.service

exit  <----- curl and check from the jumphost

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i

iptables -L

iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8087 -j ACCEPT

service iptables save
iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables:[  OK  ]

exit

curl http://stapp01:8087
