QUESTION:

The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 6100 on all app servers.

SOLUTION:

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i

sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Listen 6100    				# <------------- make sure it is listening on it

sudo systemctl restart httpd

sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 6100
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:6100          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      649/sendmail: accept

sudo systemctl stop sendmail
sudo systemctl disable sendmail

sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 6100

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
