Question:

The Nautilus team requires their data to remain strictly confidential and accessible only to members of their dbadmin group, due to security concerns. To support this:

Set up a collaborative directory at /dbadmin/data on App Server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter.

The directory must be group-owned by the dbadmin group.

All files created within this directory should also be owned by the dbadmin group by default.

Permissions should be set so that only the directory's owner and group members have read, write, and execute access.

No access should be granted to others.

Solution:

ssh steve@stapp02

enter the password:

sudo mkdir -p /dbadmin/data

sudo chmod 770 /dbadmin/data

sudo chown :dbadmin /dbadmin/data

ls -l /dbadmin/data
