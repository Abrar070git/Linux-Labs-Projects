QUESTION:

We have some users on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Some of them have been assigned some new roles and responsibilities, therefore their users need to be upgraded with sudo access so that they can perform admin level tasks.

a. Provide sudo access to user james on all app servers.

b. Make sure you have set up password-less sudo for the user.

ssh tony@stapp01  ---> enter the password
sudo su -	  ---> become root user
visudo            --->  <Edit sudoers file>
james    ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL

ssh steve@stapp02  ---> enter the password
sudo su -         ---> become root user
visudo            --->  <Edit sudoers file>
james    ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL

ssh banner@stapp03  ---> enter the password
sudo su -         ---> become root user
visudo            --->  <Edit sudoers file>
james    ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL
